# Messaging-Forum
A local messaging website I created for a school project in 8th grade.

While this messaging prototype only works locally, it was my first major project using HTML, CSS, JS, and PHP. Some other things I learned along the way were AJAX, and regular expressions. I made this at the end of senior year, 2019.

One challenge I faced while creating this project was the complexity of integrating multiple different programming languages together to create one working environment. Though it took time, I eventually learned how each component relied on another, and how each has its own pros and cons.
